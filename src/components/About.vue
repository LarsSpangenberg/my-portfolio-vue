          <h1>Hi, I'm Lars. Nice to meet you!</h1>
          <p>I have been teaching myself coding for about 3 years and I am consistently
          growing and learning more to adapt to the fast changing environment in the
          tech world.</p>
          <p>My current stack includes the MERN stack along with Redux, Vue js, Jquery,
          and many other complementing libraries. I have also been coding a lot in Java
          and Android.</p>
